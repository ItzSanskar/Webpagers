<h1>Koshi river</h1>
<br>
<p>Koshi river is the largest river of Nepal. It is located in the west of <b>Sunsari</b> district. It is formed by its seven tributaries; Arun, Likhu, Tamor, Sunkoshi, Tamakoshi, Dudhkoshi, and Indrawati. Sunkoshi comes from the west with the confluence of it with Indrawati, Tamakoshi, Likhu, and Dudhkoshi. Similarly, Arun comes from Tibet and Tamor comes from the east and finally, the confluence of Arun, Tamor and Sunkoshi forms Koshi river. There is also a holy place just south to the confluence which is called Varahakshetra Dham. It is said that Lord Vishnu's 3rd avatar, Varaha Avatar has connection with this place. Below are the images of both Varahakshetra Dham and the Confluence of rivers for the formation of Koshi river</p>
